10/28 changes - added logic to determine if each player has placed their 9 peices and started the isMill function to determine if a mill has been formed. All possible mills include: (Buttons 1, 2, 3), (Buttons 4, 5, 6), (Buttons 7, 8, 9), (Buttons 10, 11, 12), (Buttons 13, 14, 15), (Buttons 16, 17, 18), (Buttons 19, 20, 21), (Buttons 22, 23, 24), (Buttons 1, 10, 22), (Buttons 4, 11, 19), (Buttons 7, 12, 16), (Buttons 2, 5, 8), (Buttons 17, 20, 23), (Buttons 9, 13, 18), (Buttons 6, 14, 22), (Buttons 3, 15, 24) the logic needs to be implemented for both white and black pieces

10/30 changes - logic to determine mills has been implemented, still needs to be connected to the Buttons class. Still need to develop logic to stop the turn from changing if a mill has been formed, reenable buttons for the player that formed the mill to remove an opponent piece then lock them again, enable current player buttons and empty adjacent buttons to make a move, determine when a player has 3 peices left, and when the game has ended
